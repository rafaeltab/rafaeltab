# Hi, I’m Rafael 👋

## Software Engineer | Developer Experience Advocate | Open Source Enthusiast

I began coding at 13 and have been driven ever since by a passion for developer experience and open source. I believe the best products are built on solid codebases, clear documentation, and empowered developers.

**My motto:**  
`learn, practice, inspire`  
I’m always learning new things, practicing and refining my craft, and sharing what I know to help and inspire others.

### 💡 Philosophy

> "Code should empower, not frustrate. If the developer experience isn’t great, the product won’t be either."

Wherever I work, I strive to raise the bar for code quality, documentation, and developer experience. I take pride in cleaning up warnings, improving docs, and building systems where developers feel confident and productive.

### 🛠️ My Skillset

I’ve worked professionally for several years and picked up a wide variety of languages and tools along the way. If I don’t know something today, I’m confident I can learn it quickly. My favorite languages right now are Rust and TypeScript, thanks to their type systems—but what matters most to me is using the right tool for the job and building great things together.
